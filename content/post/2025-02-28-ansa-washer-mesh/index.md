When using Ansa to build surface meshes, we all hope that the round holes can be processed into the form of washer meshes to facilitate adding constraints later.

But the mesh screw holes generated by the default settings don't seem to be processed by washer.

There are several ways to do this. One is to manually add `Zone Cut` by geometry processing. This method is too labor intensive and is not recommended.

Another method requires manually `Reconstruct` the mesh, first set the characteristic parameters of the hole in the mesh parameter settings.

Return to `Mesh` and `Reconstrust` will appear.
