      <description>&lt;p&gt;The STAR-CCM+ Simulation Assistant is equivalent to a plug-in that encapsulates Java macro commands. By calling macro commands, some procedural operations are performed. Compared with directly executing Java macro files, it can interact with users better and is obviously more friendly to users who are not familiar with Java. Because the simulation assistant is mostly used in pre- and post-processing, many consulting companies tend to adopt the same approach when developing customized plug-ins for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Debug STAR-CCM&#43; macros with VSCode</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, the recording and writing of STAR-CCM+ macro files are essentially Java files, so it can be developed and debugged using Java programming methods. If complex business scenarios are involved, additional functions need to be added. The program itself is relatively complex, and it is difficult to wait until the entire program is written before testing it. It is inevitable to debug during the development process. The development tool used by the official document is the old version of &lt;strong&gt;NetBeans&lt;/strong&gt;. Many functions have changed. In addition, the official document description is too simple. Most people are still confused about the debugging process of STAR-CCM+ after reading it.&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VSCode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; As a leader in emerging IDE, you can not only support Java programming through expansion, but also &lt;a href=&#34;https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/Uz4t8yZbNmpyo1CVtqKWP&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;copilot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; To expand the integrated powerful AI programming capabilities, this article uses &lt;strong&gt;VSCode&lt;/strong&gt; to demonstrate the debugging process of STAR-CCM+ macro files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>STAR-CCM&#43; macro file recording and writing</title>
      <link>https://andrewmoa.site/post/2025-04-17-starccm-record-and-write-marco/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STAR-CCM+ macro is essentially a java file, and the syntax is no different from ordinary java. Using macros can help us simplify the processing process, especially some repetitive process operations. Completing some process operations by writing macro files can greatly liberate human resources, and even complete certain operations during the solution process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-record-macros&#34;&gt;1. Record macros&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The essence of STAR-CCM+ macro is a collection of various operation commands in the analysis process. Instead of explaining the complex and cumbersome java syntax + API from scratch, it is better to start with engineering issues directly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
